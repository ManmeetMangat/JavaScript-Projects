# JavaScript Projects

This repository contains all my JavaScript projects, assignments, and practice challenges from the course.  
Each project demonstrates different JavaScript concepts, problem-solving techniques, and coding practices I have learned.  

I will continue adding new code throughout the course and keep the repository updated for review and feedback.
